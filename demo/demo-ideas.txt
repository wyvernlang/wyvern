From earlier plans

Demo of Wyvern Web App
	Representative of current practice
		Java + JavaScript mobile web app
			demo integer overflow
			demo command injection (SQL or xQuery)
			demo authentication/auth/direct obj ref/session mgmt
				from using a third-party library that isn't visible at top level
	Wyvern equivalent
		integers don't overflow (simply the "right model")
		commands aren't strings (easier than if they were)
		doesn't compile with third-party library
			replace with correct library
			OR change architecture - but then visible
		
	Why unique
		usability (integers, commands)
		comprehensiveness (architectural approach)
	Why this is science (for NSA)
